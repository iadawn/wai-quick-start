These are introductory tips to help you start with accessibility. While not an exhaustive list of requirements, they cover important points that will help you better incorporate accessibility into your visual and interaction designs.

## Provide sufficient contrast between colors

Wherever text is displayed, including on buttons, check that you have chosen foreground/background color combinations that have sufficient contrast. For text on a background image check a sample of dominant colors or provide some way to make the text stand out. Where color is used to differentiate two or more objects, ensure that contrast is checked between the colors of adjacent objects.

## Don't use color alone to signify meaning

Color can be a useful indicator of emphasis or meaning but can never be the only way such meaning is conveyed. Use additional notification methods that do not rely on color perception when using color to differentiate elements, for example in graphs or maps, or when highlighting information, for example required form fields or important text.

## Ensure interactive elements are easily identified

Provide distinct styles for the inactive and active states of interactive elements, including links. This includes mouse hover, keyboard focus, and possibly even when it is activated on a touch device. Ensure the alternative styling provides sufficient contrast, and make the element easily identifiable.

## Provide consistent navigation and orientation information

Ensure page designs include clear and consistent navigation that indicate where in a site the user is, for example, breadcrumbs, and how they can access other areas of the site, for example, primary navigation in a header. Secondary navigation styles may be required for specific web content, such as products in an online store. Aim for consistency in style if secondary navigation is used in many different places.

## Provide visible controls for audio and video players

For designs that include audio or video content, ensure that there is provision for controls for the player. The controls should include as a minimum start, pause, seek controls, and volume controls. Ensure their position, size, and styling make them sufficiently prominent.

## Ensure form elements include clearly associated labels

When creating forms, ensure that all elements have a descriptive label adjacent to the element. Labels are usually positioned to the left or above the element, except for checkboxes and radio buttons where it is usually to the right. Avoid having too much distance between labels and associated elements.

## Provide clear presentation of errors

When something goes wrong, it should be extremely obvious where to find the problem. Ideally, provide a list of errors above the form, repeat the error beside the offending form element, and create a style that make the element really stand out. Inline validation can be extremely helpful for many users, but needs careful coding to ensure accessibility.

## Use headers and whitespace to group content

Text design benefits from clear headers to chunk up content, and main content that is not too wide. Ideal font size will vary for all users, so it is important to ensure that changes in the font size can be accommodated in the design, for example, by creating different layouts for different levels of zoom.

## Present text in a flexible font size and line length

Ideal font size will vary for all users, so it is important to ensure that changes in the font size can be accommodated in the design, for example, by creating different layouts for different levels of zoom. For all designs ensure that the line length is kept to about 80 characters maximum.

## Learn more about accessibility

These tips are important points to consider when designing accessible websites, but there is always more to learn. The following resources will help you find out more about accessibility, why it is important, and what guidelines exist to help support people with disabilities accessing the web.
